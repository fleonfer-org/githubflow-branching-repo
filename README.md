## Advantages:
Simplicity: easy to adopt
Continuous Integration: encourages rapid integration and deployment, reducing time between development and release
Flexibility: works well for small and large teams

## Challenges:
Lack of structure: possible issues if not managed properly
No dedicated release branches: managing long-running features or hotfixes can be challenging without a dedicated release process

## Branch:
Master/main (default): primary branch, always in a deployable state
Feature: for new features or fixes and merged back into master/main once completed
